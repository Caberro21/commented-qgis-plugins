# Commented QGIS plugins

A collection of densely commented versions of certain QGIS plugins, so they can be read and serve as a learning tool.

Some plugins might have been modified from their regular versions, to make them more readable. Also, they might not be in sync with the latest releases, since plugins in this repo are not updated when newer versions of the original ones are released.

Plugins in this repo might not be functional (do not try to install them), since some of them require dependencies, and they havent been added, to keep the number of files to a minimum and make the code and file structure more readable.

The ``_build`` folder contains scripts to create a website from the plugin source files, which can be used to browse the code in a practical and helpful way. It includes syntax coloring, and methods and classes from QGIS and PyQt used in the code are shown with hyperlinks to the corresponding documentation that explains them.

You can browse a live version of that website [here](https://volaya.github.io/commented-qgis-plugins/).
