# Commented QGIS plugins

A collection of densely commented versions of certain QGIS plugins, so they can be read and serve as a learning tool.

Some plugins might have been modified from their regular versions, to make them more readable. Also, they might not be in sync with the latest releases, since plugins in this repo are not updated when newer versions of the original ones are released.

Plugins in this repo might not be functional (do not try to install them), since some of them require dependencies, and they havent been added, to keep the number of files to a minimum and make the code and file structure more readable.

Here is a list of the plugins contained in this repo, with a short description of their main features and their main areas of interest

- *what3words*: This plugin uses a *map tool* to capture user interaction in the map canvas. It also features a *Processing provider*, so the capabilities of the plugin (converting coordinates into what3words coordinates) are available as a Processing algorithm and can be used in the Processing elements (toolbox, modeler, batch interface, etc.)
